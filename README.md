## Description
SwiftLink is a service that allows users to create short and easy-to-share URLs from long and complex ones. It is built with React.js for the frontend and ExpressJS/NodeJS for the backend. It also uses MongoDB as a database service to store the URL mappings and visitors analytics.

## Overview

### Features

- [x] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] Shorten any valid URL
- [x] See the analytics of the shortened url.

- [x] Receive an error message when the `input` is invalid
- [ ] Can make custom short url.
