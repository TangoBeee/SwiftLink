# SwiftLink

This is a fullstack url shortening project build with reactjs and expressjs/nodejs

## Description
SwiftLink is a service that allows users to create short and easy-to-share URLs from long and complex ones. It is built with React.js for the frontend and ExpressJS/NodeJS for the backend. It also uses MongoDB as a database service to store the URL mappings and visitors analytics.

## Overview

### Features 
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See the analytics of the shortened url.
- Can preview the redirect url by just adding `+` symbol after the shortId (i.e. domain.com/xjD7kdLp+).
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `input` is invalid
